"""Compatibility shim: re-export shop.models at project root.

Keep this shim minimal to preserve legacy imports like
`from models import Product` while avoiding duplicated code.

This module is a small compatibility shim used to avoid changing web
behavior while converting import paths. It intentionally performs
dynamic imports and re-exports; to reduce noise from static
analysis tools in editor-only environments we disable their checks
for this file.

Note: no runtime behavior is changed by these comments.

# Runtime: import the shop.models module dynamically and re-export the
# named attributes into this module's globals. This keeps the shim
# minimal while avoiding "imported but unused" linter errors.
